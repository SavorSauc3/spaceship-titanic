# ðŸš€Welcome to my Spaceship Titanic TutorialðŸš€
## Based on my score and models from Kaggle's Spaceship Titanic CompetitionðŸ¦†

Welcome to this tutorial, if you haven't already, make sure to install all of the dependencies. **Note that this is not the same thing as importing, and your imports will not work without the dependency installations.** To install the dependencies, in the console(or by using magic commands in a notebook) "pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt". If are starting on the streamlit tutorial, and want to know how I got all of the saved models, *check out my original video on the kaggle competition*.
